* What's this?
  This directory is my playgroung to practice statistics in R. 

* Statistical significance
/Statistical significance means this data is very unlikely to happen given the null hypothesis./
- We have to have and initial hypothesis $(H_0)$ 
- Most of the time it is some parameter in the distribution we assume (e.g. $H_0$ states that the mean equals $\mu_0 = \mu$, the mean is a given number).
- We have data $\bar{x}$
